- You can use this code to reed the packet outputted by either the Tx pin of the transmitter or the Tx pin of the receiver.
- Refer to the datasheet to see the message which should be returned by the modules in case of succesfull configuration as well as in case of error.
- You should connecti the the FireBeetle 2 Board ESP32 C6 to the receiver RF125-RA to plot what it is receiving.

IMPORTANT:
- Connect the Rx pin of the FireBeetle 2 Board ESP32 C6 to the Tx pin of the receiver RF125-RA.
- Through my experiments: using the receiver I could only receive the length of the data.
